1. Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Prime Video content library using Tableau to uncover insights related to content distribution, genre popularity, ratings, release trends, and geographical availability.
An interactive dashboard was developed to help stakeholders understand viewer-targeted content strategy and platform growth patterns.
The dashboard enables quick exploration of:
Content types (Movies vs TV Shows)
-Audience ratings
-Popular genres
-Release year trends
-Country-wise content distribution

3. Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project consists of metadata related to titles available on the Prime Video streaming platform. It includes information such as show identifiers, title names, content type (movie or TV show), genre classifications, audience ratings, release years, duration, country of availability, cast details, and content descriptions. The data contains both categorical and numerical attributes and spans approximately 19,000 records, providing a comprehensive view of Prime Video’s content library. Prior to analysis, the dataset was cleaned and transformed to standardize genres, ratings, and date formats, ensuring accuracy and consistency for visualization and insight generation.
