# Prime Video Content Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Prime Video content library using Tableau to identify trends in content distribution, genre popularity, audience ratings, release patterns, and geographical availability. The objective is to provide data-driven insights that support strategic decision-making related to content acquisition, production, and audience targeting.

An interactive dashboard was developed to enable stakeholders to explore the dataset dynamically and gain actionable insights efficiently.

## Dataset Description
The dataset utilized in this project represents metadata associated with content available on the Prime Video streaming platform. It comprises structured information including unique show identifiers, title names, content classification (Movie or TV Show), genre labels, audience rating categories, release year, runtime or season details, country of availability, cast information, and textual content descriptions. The dataset contains approximately 19,000 records and includes a combination of categorical and numerical variables.

Data preprocessing was performed prior to analysis to ensure data quality and consistency. This included handling missing and inconsistent values, normalizing genre and rating fields, extracting and formatting release year information, and validating categorical attributes.
